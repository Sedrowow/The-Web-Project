Strike through explanations
---------------------------
I was on a website earlier and a large part of the article I was reading was 'strike-out' text.  I really approve of strike out stuff, as it shows what is meant to be seen but either not correct or of interest, but I was frustrated that I couldn't tell why the article had strike outs in it.  It was the idea I needed to make this little pen!
